This is a logistic regression model that has been made to predict if a person will buy a SUV or not
After looking at the features and plotting them using seaborn, i have filtered out the relevant features which are mainly salary and age
but i observed that there's a slight variation in the number of females who tend to purchase SUV's and including that further improved the accuracy
